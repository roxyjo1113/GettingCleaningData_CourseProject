#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Codebook

##Overview
Project requirements are to provide a tidy dataset with the mean and standard deviations features for each subject and activity type.

The data comes from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A dataset is created by the joining of the Training and Test datasets.  And then subsetted to pull just the mean and standard deviation features.
The data was then summarized by each individual Subject and Activity description combination.

##Data Dictionary
Column 1: Subject
    The subject number from the experiment
    
Column 2: Activity_Desc
    The activity type from the experiment
      LAYING
      SITTING
      STANDING
      WALKING
      WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      
Columns 3-68: Features - Mean and Standard Deviation only
    The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
    Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
    Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
    These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
      '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

          fBodyGyro-XYZ
          fBodyAccMag
          fBodyAccJerkMag
          fBodyGyroMag
          fBodyGyroJerkMag
      There is one column for each of the axial version for both mean and standard deviation.
      In the following format - 'Description.mean...Axial'  ie tBodyAcc.mean...X
      Unallowed characters (such as -, ()) have been removed
      Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
